Methods:

Adding Elements:
i) addFirst(E e): Inserts the specified element at the beginning of the list.
ii) addLast(E e): Appends the specified element to the end of the list.
iii) add(int index, E element): Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list.
iv) offer(E e): Adds the specified element as the tail (last element) of this list.

Removing Elements:
i)removeFirst(): Removes and returns the first element from this list.
ii)removeLast(): Removes and returns the last element from this list.
iii)remove(int index): Removes the element at the specified position in this list.
iv)remove(Object o): Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from this list, if it is present.


Accessing Elements:
i)getFirst(): Returns the first element in this list.
ii)getLast(): Returns the last element in this list.
iii)get(int index): Returns the element at the specified position in this list.


Searching Elements:
i)indexOf(Object o): Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in this list, or -1 if the list does not contain the element.
ii)lastIndexOf(Object o): Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in this list, or -1 if the list does not contain the element.
iii)contains(Object o): Returns true if this list contains the specified element.

Utility Methods:
i)isEmpty(): Returns true if this list contains no elements.
ii)size(): Returns the number of elements in this list.
iii)clear(): Removes all of the elements from this list.
iv)iterator(): Returns an iterator over the elements in this list in proper sequence.
v)listIterator(int index): Returns a list-iterator of the elements in this list (in proper sequence), starting at the specified position in the list.

Operations:

A)Traversal:
This operation involves visiting each node in the linked list sequentially, typically starting from the head, to access or process the data stored within each node.

B)Insertion:
At the beginning: Adding a new node as the new head of the linked list.
At the end: Appending a new node to the end of the linked list.
At a specific position: Inserting a new node at a designated position within the linked list, often after a specific node or at a given index.

C)Deletion:
From the beginning: Removing the head node of the linked list.
From the end: Removing the last node of the linked list.
At a specific position: Deleting a node at a designated position within the linked list, often by its value or at a given index.

D)Searching:
This operation involves iterating through the linked list to find a node containing a specific data value (key).

E)Updating (Modification):
Modifying the data value of an existing node in the linked list. This often involves first searching for the target node and then changing its data.

F)Reversal:
Changing the order of nodes in the linked list so that the last node becomes the new head and the first node becomes the new tail.

G)Sorting:
Arranging the nodes of the linked list in a specific order based on their data values (e.g., ascending or descending). This can be achieved using various sorting algorithms adapted for linked lists.
